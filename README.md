Modal Logic
===========

We implement a Python class for general Kripke frames with any number of n-ary modal operators and various methods to maniupulate them.

Some goals and todo's
---------------------
+ ~~debug make_tableau for one-place constants~~
+ ~~compute formula valuation at a word in a model~~
+ ~~generate submodel~~
+ unraveling
+ filtration (largest, smallest)
+ compute bisimularity of models/worlds at models
+ compute satisfaction of a formula by a frame
+ generate random frames
+ generate random frames for various modal logics (K, S4, S5, D, etc.)
+ compute modal equivalence
+ (graphical) drawing of frames
